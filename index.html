            <p>The interface in public view that I choose to analyze is the self-checkout machine.</p>
            <p>A self-checkout machine is a machine that allows customers to check out in a retail store without having
                to
                go
                through a clerk, which can be used to replace traditional cashiers.
                Self-checkout gives consumers more choices, convenience and speed, and avoiding long queues is also a
                major
                reason
                why many consumers prefer self-checkout.
            </p>
            <p>Specifically, I will use CVS self-checkout machines as an example.</p>

                Users scan their items one-by-one using the barcode reader, and at the same time, users can bag their
                items.
                Then,
                the user only needs to select his preferred payment method (debit card/credit card/cash, etc.) to pay,
                and
                everything is all set.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, a self-checkout machine contains the following components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Touch screen monitor</li>
                <li>Basket stand</li>
                <li>Barcode scanner cum weighing scale</li>
                <li>ATM PIN pad</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Q1: Do you prefer the self-checkout machine or checkout by cashier? And Why?</h2>
                <!--bullet points-->
                <ul>
                    <li>User 1: Self-checkout machine. Because I can bag my items in the way I like.</li>
                    <li>User 2: Checkout by cashiers. I need to wait much longer when my items cannot be scanned or the
                        machine
                        doesn’t
                        work. And when I have a lot of items, I have to bag everything by myself (I am a really lazy
                        person).
                        And
                        the
                        weight sensor sometimes drives me crazy.
                    </li>
                    <li>User 3: Self-checkout machine. I’d rather bag everything and avoid any kind of interactions with
                        people.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h2>Q2: Is there any part of the self-checkout machine interface that you are unsatisfied with?</h2>
                <!--bullet points-->
                <ul>
                    <li>User 1: It is difficult to scan the barcode of some items. And the card reader sometimes can’t
                        read my
                        card.
                    </li>
                    <li>User 2: The sensor is sometimes too sensitive, but sometimes it cannot detect anything. I need
                        to keep
                        clicking
                        "Skip Bagging'', or even ask others for help. And when I have a lot of items, the basket stand
                        would
                        mess
                        up,
                        especially on rainy days.
                    </li>
                    <li>User 3: Generally no. It’s a pretty simple machine. But sometimes the scanner doesn't work
                        well.
                    </li>

                    store,
                    there
                    is
                    some problem with the weight sensor and cannot detect any item. The user has to go and communicate
                    with
                    the
                    clerk.
                    The user waited for a long time before the clerk came over slowly.

                    John is an impatient person who always wants to use his time efficiently. He's also a bit
                    introverted
                    and
                    doesn't
                    like unnecessary interactions with people. When he wanted to check out, there happened to be an
                    automatic
                    checkout
                    machine available, but there were still five people in line at the cashier's side.
