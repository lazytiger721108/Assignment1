        <p>
          In this project, we learned about user research. Specifically,
          we need to choose an interface, then observe and interview how users
          interact with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          User research is never easy. It is a very important part of
          the learning journey of becoming a designer, which allows us
          to discover our users’ best interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to practice and strengthen the design process, we will
          also make personas and storyboards based on the interview results,
          so as to help us understand the goals and needs of users, and
          record piratic information.

          The interface I chose was CVS self-checkout machine.
        </p>
        <p>The reason I chose CVS self-checkout machine is that when I used it
          in
          the past,
          there were often some unexpected situations that made my
          payment process even more difficult. Therefore, I wanted
          to see what other people think about the self-checkout
          machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I created two drafts with Figma, one showing the
          appearance and overall structure of a self-checkout machine,
          and the other showing the screen’s interface of a machine.

        In order to construct user personas and storyboards, as a designer and
        UI researcher, I have to conduct an ethnographic study of the user group
        of self-checkout machines.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #fff;font-size: 20px;font-weight: normal;">

        During this process, I observed whether the respondents had any difficulties using the self-checkout machine,
        and then interviewed them with two questions..

      <div style="margin-top: 50px">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Q1: Do you prefer the self-checkout machine or checkout by cashier? And
              Why?</p>
            <p>Self-checkout machine:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>·bag my items in the way I like;</li>
              <li>·avoid any kind of interactions with people;</li>
              <li>·usually it's faster</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cashier:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>·need to wait much longer when my items cannot be scanned or the
                machine
                doesn’t work;
              </li>
              <li>·have to bag everything by myself;</li>
              <li>·sensor sometimes drives me</li>

        <div style="margin-top: 50px">
          <div>
            <p>Q2:Is there any part of the self-checkout machine interface that you are
              unsatisfied with/can be improved?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>·It is difficult to scan the barcode of some items. And the card
                reader
                sometimes can’t read cards.
              </li>
              <li>·The sensor is sometimes too sensitive, but sometimes it cannot
                detect anything. I need to keep clicking "Skip Bagging'', or even
                ask others for help. And when I have a lot of items, the basket
                stand would mess up, especially on rainy days.
              </li>
              <li>·It’s a pretty simple machine. But sometimes the scanner doesn't
                work
                well.

        Then, I synthesized quantitative and qualitative research data retrieved from the interview process, which is a
        very critical preparation of constructing personas and storyboards.

        According to the interview results, and some common behaviors of users I observed, I constructed 2 personas,
        each one is a four-quadrant empathy map.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each empathy map, I provide some contextual information about users' environment, and show the main
        characteristics, ambitions, and frustrations of users I observed.

        Eric is a rushed student and his next class will begin in 5 minutes. But when he is in the grocery store, there
        is some problem with the weight sensor and cannot detect any item. The user has to go and communicate with the
        clerk. The user waited for a long time before the clerk came over slowly.

        John is an impatient person who always wants to use his time efficiently. He's also a bit introverted and
        doesn't like unnecessary interactions with people. When he wanted to check out, there happened to be an
        automatic checkout machine available, but there were still five people in line at the cashier's side.

      <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
      <p>
        Next, we need to create a storyboard for our persona's user journey from start to end, which is a visual
        representation of a story. In this process, as a designer, we need to create a reasonable scenario, and conceive
        some specific details of human-computer interaction, such as user emotion and machine interface changes, and so
        on.

            Everything is all set! Eric put this milk into the bag and

      <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
      <p>
        Persona and storyboarding, two effective tools for a designer, not only enable me to better understand how
        groups of users interact with a product, but also further my understanding of a product.

        During this assignment, I learned a lot of lessons. First of all, I should clearly state my observation, which
        is different from interviews. Second, the storyboard is built based on the persona, so the storyboard must fit
        the persona exactly.

        Based on the reviewers' feedback, if I have time, I will refactor my persona and storyboard to make my
        storyboard better match my persona. Moreover, I will have more interview questions, such as users' views on a
        certain component, etc., in order to understand the user experience more comprehensively.
